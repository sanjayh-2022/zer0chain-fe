# Zer0 Chain Wallet

## Introduction

**Zer0chain Wallet** is an account-abstracted and chain-abstracted wallet designed to simplify Web3 onboarding and transaction management. With AI-powered workflows and a WhatsApp-based interface, it offers an intuitive, text or voice-driven way to manage your wallet, making crypto transactions as easy as sending a message.

The wallet uses **Anon Aadhaar**, a privacy-focused ZK protocol for user verification before wallet creation, ensuring secure and anonymous identity validation. For high-cost transactions, Zer0chain Wallet leverages LIT Protocol, which adds an extra layer of security, safeguarding transactions and reducing the risk of fraud.
